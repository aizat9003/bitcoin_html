                    2020 was a crazy year for bitcoin. After several institutional investors making their investment in bitcoin, its value skyrocketed to unprecendented levels resulting in multiple all-time highs (ATH). On top of that, more retail investors have joined the fray to capitalise on bitcoin's allure as an alternative store of value thanks to gold's declining value and the weakened US dollar.

                    <h2>Why I invest in bitcoin</h2>
            
                    <p>Before I begin, I want emphasise that <strong> this is not an investment advice</strong>. Before making any investment, you should do your own research to assess your risk tolerance. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. With that said, I want to list out why I invest in bitcoin:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>To diversify my portfolio</li>
                        <li>I see bitcoin as an alternative investment to gold</li>
                        <li>Hedge against inflation. As a cryptocurrency, bitcoin has lower risk of inflation</li>
                        <li>A great vehicle for long-term investment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How Invest in bitcoin</h2>
              
                    <p>Bitcoin investment is becoming more popular among investors today and there are many strategies one can use. For me, I prefer using the dollar cost averaging (DCA) method. Here are the reasons why:</p>   
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>I'm less worried about bitcoin's insane value</em>. I don't know about you but bitcoin's volatility can earn you several sleepless nights.</li>
                        <li><em>I'm in it for the long run</em>. I believe DCA-ing will average out the purchase price over time (5-10 years for example)</li>
                        <li>Unlike stocks and some other investment assets, <em>bitcoin can be bought for any amount of money and there is no minimum purchase requirement</em>. This is perfect for when I want to adjust my DCA amount</li>
                    </ol>
